Positions of Large Groups
---

# Description
In a string S of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like S = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z" and "yy".

Call a group large if it has 3 or more characters.  We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.

The final answer should be in lexicographic order.

 

Example 1:

Input: "abbxxxxzzy"
Output: [[3,6]]
Explanation: "xxxx" is the single large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.
Example 2:

Input: "abc"
Output: []
Explanation: We have "a","b" and "c" but no large group.
Example 3:

Input: "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]
 

Note:  1 <= S.length <= 1000

# Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} S
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var largeGroupPositions = function(S) {
    var res = [], tmp = [], start = 0, count = 0;
    for(var i = 1; i < S.length; i++) {
        if(S[i] == S[i-1]) {
            count++;
        } else {
            if(count >= 2) {
                tmp = [start, i-1];
                res.push(tmp);
            }
            count = 0;
            start = i;
        }
    }
    if(count >= 2)
        res.push([start, i-1]);
    return res;
};
```
