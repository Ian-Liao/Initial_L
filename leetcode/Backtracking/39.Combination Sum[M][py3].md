Combination Sum
---

# Description
Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.

Note:

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]
Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [2,2,2,2],
  [2,3,3],
  [3,5]
]

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        candy = sorted(candidates)
        res = []
        def dfs(remain, combo, index):
            if remain == 0:
                res.append(combo)
                return
            
            for i in range(index, len(candy)):
                if candy[i] > remain:
                    break
                    
                dfs(remain - candy[i], combo + [candy[i]], i)
                
        dfs(target, [], 0)        
        return res
```
