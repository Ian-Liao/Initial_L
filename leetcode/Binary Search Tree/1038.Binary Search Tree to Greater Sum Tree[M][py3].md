Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree
---

# Description
Given the root of a binary search tree with distinct values, modify it so that every node has a new value equal to the sum of the values of the original tree that are greater than or equal to node.val.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

Example 1:



Input: [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 100.
Each node will have value between 0 and 100.
The given tree is a binary search tree.
Note: This question is the same as 538: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/

# Solution
```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def bstToGst(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        res = self.helper(root, 0)
        return root
    
    def helper(self, node, prev):
        if not node:
            return prev
        right = self.helper(node.right, prev)
        node.val += right
        left = self.helper(node.left, node.val)
        return left
```
