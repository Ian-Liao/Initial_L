Search in Rotated Sorted Array
---

# Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l, h = 0, len(nums)
        while l < h:
            m = (l + h) // 2
            if target < nums[0] < nums[m]:  # -inf
                l = m + 1
            elif nums[m] < nums[0] <= target:   # inf
                h = m
            elif nums[m] < target:
                l = m + 1
            elif nums[m] > target:
                h = m
            else:
                return m
            
        return -1
```
