Maximum Product of Word Lengths
---

# Description
Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Output: 16 
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
Example 2:

Input: ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
Example 3:

Input: ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: 0 
Explanation: No such pair of words.

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        d = {}
        for word in words:
            mask = 0
            for c in set(word):
                mask |= 1 << (ord(c) - ord('a'))
            d[mask] = max(d.get(mask, 0), len(word))
        return max([d[x] * d[y] for x in d for y in d if x & y == 0] or [0])
```
