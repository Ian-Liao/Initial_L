01 Matrix
---

# Description
Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

 

Example 1:

Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]]

Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]]
Example 2:

Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,1,1]]

Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,2,1]]
 

Note:

The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.
There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.
The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def updateMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if len(matrix) == 0: return matrix
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        directions = [(0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]
        limit = m + n
        q = deque()
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    q.append((i, j))
                else:
                    matrix[i][j] = limit
                    
        while q:
            cell = q.popleft()
            for direction in directions:
                x, y = cell[0] + direction[0], cell[1] + direction[1]
                if 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n and matrix[x][y] > matrix[cell[0]][cell[1]] + 1:
                    matrix[x][y] = matrix[cell[0]][cell[1]] + 1
                    q.append((x, y))
        return matrix
```
