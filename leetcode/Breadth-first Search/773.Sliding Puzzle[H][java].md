Sliding Puzzle
---

# Description
On a 2x3 board, there are 5 tiles represented by the integers 1 through 5, and an empty square represented by 0.

A move consists of choosing 0 and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.

The state of the board is solved if and only if the board is [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]].

Given a puzzle board, return the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return -1.

Examples:

Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No number of moves will make the board solved.
Input: board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
An example path:
After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]
Input: board = [[3,2,4],[1,5,0]]
Output: 14

# Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int slidingPuzzle(int[][] board) {
        String target = "123450";
        String begin = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++)
                begin += board[i][j];

        int[][] nums = new int[][]{{1, 3}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 5}, {0, 4}, {1, 3, 5}, {2, 4}};
        HashSet<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int res = 0;
        visited.add(begin);
        queue.offer(begin);
        while (!queue.isEmpty())
        {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
            {
                String cur = queue.poll();
                int zeroPos = cur.indexOf('0');
                if (cur.equals(target)) return res;
                for (int num : nums[zeroPos])
                {
                    String next = swap(cur, zeroPos, num);
                    if (visited.contains(next)) continue;
                    visited.add(next);
                    queue.offer(next);
                }
            }
            res++;
        }
        return -1;
    }

    private String swap(String str, int i, int j)
    {
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(str);
        sb.setCharAt(i, str.charAt(j));
        sb.setCharAt(j, str.charAt(i));
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
