Bus Routes
---

# Description
We have a list of bus routes. Each routes[i] is a bus route that the i-th bus repeats forever. For example if routes[0] = [1, 5, 7], this means that the first bus (0-th indexed) travels in the sequence 1->5->7->1->5->7->1->... forever.

We start at bus stop S (initially not on a bus), and we want to go to bus stop T. Travelling by buses only, what is the least number of buses we must take to reach our destination? Return -1 if it is not possible.

Example:
Input: 
routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]]
S = 1
T = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= routes.length <= 500.
1 <= routes[i].length <= 10^5.
0 <= routes[i][j] < 10 ^ 6.

# Solution
```java
class Solution:
    def numBusesToDestination(self, routes: List[List[int]], S: int, T: int) -> int:
        if S == T: return 0
        length = len(routes)
        routes = list(map(set, routes))
        graph = collections.defaultdict(set)
        for i, r1 in enumerate(routes):
            for j in range(i+1, length):
                r2 = routes[j]
                if r1 & r2:
                    graph[i].add(j)
                    graph[j].add(i)
                    
        seen, targets = set(), set()
        for i, r in enumerate(routes):
            if S in r:
                seen.add(i)
            if T in r:
                targets.add(i)
                
        queue = [(s, 1) for s in seen]
        for q, depth in queue:
            if q in targets:
                return depth
            for nei in graph[q]:
                if nei not in seen:
                    seen.add(nei)
                    queue.append((nei, depth+1))
                    
        return -1
```
