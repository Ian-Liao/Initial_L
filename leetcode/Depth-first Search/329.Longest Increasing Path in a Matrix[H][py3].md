Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix
---

# Description
Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).

Example 1:

Input: nums = 
[
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
] 
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
Example 2:

Input: nums = 
[
  [3,4,5],
  [3,2,6],
  [2,2,1]
] 
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def longestIncreasingPath(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if len(matrix) == 0: return 0
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
        cache = [[-1 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        def dfs(x, y):
            if cache[x][y] != -1: return cache[x][y]
            ans = 1
            for direction in directions:
                a, b = x + direction[0], y + direction[1]
                length = 0
                if 0 <= a < m and 0 <= b < n and matrix[a][b] > matrix[x][y]:
                    length = 1 + dfs(a, b)
                ans = max(ans, length)  
            cache[x][y] = ans
            return ans
        
        res = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                cur = dfs(i, j)
                res = max(res, cur)
        return res
```
