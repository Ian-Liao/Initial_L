Combination Sum IV
---

# Description
Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

Example:

nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.
 

Follow up:
What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
How does it change the problem?
What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        nums = sorted(nums)
        res, dp = 0, [1] + [0] * target
        for i in range(1, len(dp)):
            for num in nums:
                if num > i:
                    break
                elif num == i:
                    dp[i] += 1
                else:
                    dp[i] += dp[i-num]
                    
        return dp[target]
```
