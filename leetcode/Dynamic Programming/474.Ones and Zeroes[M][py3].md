# Description
Given an array, strs, with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s. Also two integers m and n.

Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m 0s and n 1s. Each 0 and 1 can be used at most once.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are "10","0001","1","0".
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: You could form "10", but then you'd have nothing left. Better form "0" and "1".
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 600
1 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists only of digits '0' and '1'.
1 <= m, n <= 100

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def findMaxForm(self, strs: List[str], m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
        def count(s):
            return sum([1 for x in s if x == '0']), sum([1 for y in s if y == '1'])
        
        for s in strs:
            z, o = count(s)
            for x in range(m, -1 , -1):
                for y in range(n, -1, -1):
                    if x >= z and y >= o:
                        dp[x][y] = max(1+dp[x-z][y-o], dp[x][y])
                        
        return dp[m][n]
```
