Knight Dialer
---

# Description
A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

 .



This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad (indicated above), and the knight makes N-1 hops.  Each hop must be from one key to another numbered key.

Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight), it presses the number of that key, pressing N digits total.

How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?

Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.



Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: 10
Example 2:

Input: 2
Output: 20
Example 3:

Input: 3
Output: 46

# Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int knightDialer(int N) {
        if (N == 1) return 10;
        long[] cur = new long[10];
        Arrays.fill(cur, 1);
        long[] next = new long[10];
        cur[5] = 0;
        long M = (int)1e9 + 7;
        while (N-- > 1)
        {
            next = Arrays.copyOf(next, 10);
            next[0] = (cur[4] + cur[6]) % M;
            next[1] = (cur[6] + cur[8]) % M;
            next[2] = (cur[7] + cur[9]) % M;
            next[3] = (cur[4] + cur[8]) % M;
            next[4] = (cur[3] + cur[9] + cur[0]) % M;
            next[5] = (cur[5]) % M;
            next[6] = (cur[1] + cur[7] + cur[0]) % M;
            next[7] = (cur[2] + cur[6]) % M;
            next[8] = (cur[1] + cur[3]) % M;
            next[9] = (cur[2] + cur[4]) % M;
            cur = next;
        }
        long res = 0;
        for (long num : cur) res = (res + num) % M;
        return (int)res;
    }
}
```
