Course Schedule

# Description
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

# Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        ArrayList[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];
        int[] inDegree = new int[numCourses];
        Queue queue = new LinkedList();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) graph[i] = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        for (int i = 0; i < prerequisites.length; i++)
        {
            graph[prerequisites[i][1]].add(prerequisites[i][0]);
            inDegree[prerequisites[i][0]]++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++)
            if (inDegree[i] == 0)
            {
                queue.add(i);
                count++;
            }
        while (queue.size() != 0)
        {
            int source = (int)queue.poll();
            for (int i = 0; i < graph[source].size(); i++)
            {
                int node = (int)graph[source].get(i);
                inDegree[node]--;
                if (inDegree[node] == 0)
                {
                    queue.add(node);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count == numCourses;
    }
}
```
