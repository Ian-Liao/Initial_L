Partition Labels
---

# Description
A string S of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
Note:

S will have length in range [1, 500].
S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, S: str) -> List[int]:
        last = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(S)}
        dest, count = 0, 0
        res = []
        for i, c in enumerate(S):
            dest = max(dest, last[c])
            count += 1
            if i == dest:
                res.append(count)
                count = 0
        return res
```
