Find All Anagrams in a String
---

# Description
Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:

Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        p_count = collections.Counter(p)
        s_count = collections.Counter(s[:len(p)-1])
        res = []
        for i in range(len(p)-1, len(s)):
            s_count[s[i]] += 1
            if s_count == p_count:
                res.append(i-len(p)+1)
            s_count[s[i-len(p)+1]] -= 1
            if s_count[s[i-len(p)+1]] == 0:
                del s_count[s[i-len(p)+1]]
        return res
```
