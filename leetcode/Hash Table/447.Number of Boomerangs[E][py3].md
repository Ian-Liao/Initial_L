Number of Boomerangs
---

# Description
Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).

Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).

Example:

Input:
[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def numberOfBoomerangs(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if len(points) == 0: return 0
        res = 0
        for p in points:
            dists = {}
            for q in points:
                x = p[0] - q[0]
                y = p[1] - q[1]
                dists[x*x + y*y] = 1 + dists.get(x*x + y*y, 0)
            for d in dists:
                res += dists[d] * (dists[d] - 1)
        return res
```
