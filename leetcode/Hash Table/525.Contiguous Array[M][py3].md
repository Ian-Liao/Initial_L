Contiguous Array
---

# Description
Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

Example 1:
Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
Example 2:
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
Note: The length of the given binary array will not exceed 50,000.

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def findMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        record = {0: -1}
        res, count = 0, 0
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            count += 1 if num == 1 else -1
            if count in record:
                res = max(res, i - record[count])
            else:
                record[count] = i
        return res
```
