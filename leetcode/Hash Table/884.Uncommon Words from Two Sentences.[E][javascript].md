Uncommon Words from Two Sentences
---

# Description
We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words. 

You may return the list in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]
Example 2:

Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
Output: ["banana"]
 

Note:

0 <= A.length <= 200
0 <= B.length <= 200
A and B both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.

# Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} A
 * @param {string} B
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var uncommonFromSentences = function(A, B) {
    var dict = {};
    var combined = A + " " + B;
    var words = combined.split(" ");
    for (word of words) {
        if(dict[word] == undefined)
            dict[word] = 1;
        else
            dict[word]++;
    }
    var res = [];
    for (let d of Object.keys(dict)) {
        if (dict[d] == 1)
            res.push(d);
    }
    return res;
};
```
