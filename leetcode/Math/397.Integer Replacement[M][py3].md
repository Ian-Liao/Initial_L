Integer Replacement
---

# Description
Given a positive integer n and you can do operations as follow:

If n is even, replace n with n/2.
If n is odd, you can replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
What is the minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1?

Example 1:

Input:
8

Output:
3

Explanation:
8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
Example 2:

Input:
7

Output:
4

Explanation:
7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
or
7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while n > 1:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                n //= 2
            elif n % 4 == 3 and n > 3:
                n += 1
            else:
                n -= 1
            res += 1
        return res
```
