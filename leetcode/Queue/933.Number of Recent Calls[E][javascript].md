Number of Recent Calls
---

# Description
Write a class RecentCounter to count recent requests.

It has only one method: ping(int t), where t represents some time in milliseconds.

Return the number of pings that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.

Any ping with time in [t - 3000, t] will count, including the current ping.

It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than before.

 

Example 1:

Input: inputs = ["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"], inputs = [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]
Output: [null,1,2,3,3]
 

Note:

Each test case will have at most 10000 calls to ping.
Each test case will call ping with strictly increasing values of t.
Each call to ping will have 1 <= t <= 10^9.


# Solution
```javascript

var RecentCounter = function() {
    this.record = [];
};

/** 
 * @param {number} t
 * @return {number}
 */
RecentCounter.prototype.ping = function(t) {
    this.record.push(t);
    for(var i=0; i < this.record.length; i++) {
        if(this.record[i] >= t - 3000) {
            return this.record.length - i;
        }
    }
    
};

/** 
 * Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = Object.create(RecentCounter).createNew()
 * var param_1 = obj.ping(t)
 */
 ```
