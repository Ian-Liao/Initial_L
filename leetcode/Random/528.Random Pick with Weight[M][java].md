Random Pick with Weight
---

# Description
Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:

1 <= w.length <= 10000
1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]
Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.


# Solution
```java
class Solution {
    Random random;
    int[] wsum;

    public Solution(int[] w) {
        random = new Random();
        wsum = new int[w.length];
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < w.length; i++) {
            total += w[i];
            wsum[i] = total;
        }    
    }
    
    public int pickIndex() {
        int len = wsum.length;
        int ptr = random.nextInt(wsum[len-1]) + 1;
        int left = 0, right = len - 1;
        while(left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if(wsum[mid] == ptr) return mid;
            else if(wsum[mid] < ptr) left = mid + 1;
            else if(wsum[mid] > ptr) right = mid;
        }
        return left;
    }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(w);
 * int param_1 = obj.pickIndex();
 */
 ```
