Repeated DNA Sequences
---

# Description
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

Example:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        repeated, recorded = set(), set()
        for i in range(len(s) - 9):
            substring = s[i:i+10]
            if substring in recorded:
                repeated.add(substring)
            else:
                recorded.add(substring)
                
        return list(repeated)
```
