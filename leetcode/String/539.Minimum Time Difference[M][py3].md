Minimum Time Difference
---

# Description
Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "Hour:Minutes" format, find the minimum minutes difference between any two time points in the list.
Example 1:
Input: ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
Note:
The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.
The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59.

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: List[str]) -> int:
        sequence = sorted(int(point[:2]) * 60 + int(point[3:]) for point in timePoints)
        sequence.append(sequence[0] + 24*60)
        return min(y - x for x, y in zip(sequence, sequence[1:]))
```
