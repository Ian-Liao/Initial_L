Delete Node in a BST
---

# Description
Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

Example:

root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7

# Solution
```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, root: TreeNode, key: int) -> TreeNode:
        if not root:
            return root
        if key < root.val:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        elif key > root.val:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
        else:
            if not root.left:
                return root.right
            if not root.right:
                return root.left
            else:
                tmp = root.right
                while tmp.left:
                    tmp = tmp.left
                root.val = tmp.val    
                root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, tmp.val)
        return root
```
