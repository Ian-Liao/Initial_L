Find Mode in Binary Search Tree
---

# Description
Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

For example:
Given BST [1,null,2,2],

   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
 

return [2].

Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

# Solution
```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def findMode(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        if root is None: return []
        count = collections.Counter()
        def dfs(node):
            if node is not None:
                count[node.val] += 1
                dfs(node.left)
                dfs(node.right)
            
        dfs(root)
        max_val = max(count.values())
        return [i for i, val in count.items() if val == max_val]
```
