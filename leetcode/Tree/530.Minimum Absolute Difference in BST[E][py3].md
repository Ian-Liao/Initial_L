Minimum Absolute Difference in BST
---

# Description
Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes.

Example:

Input:

   1
    \
     3
    /
   2

Output:
1

Explanation:
The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
 

Note:

There are at least two nodes in this BST.
This question is the same as 783: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/

# Solution
```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def getMinimumDifference(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        seq = []
        def helper(node):
            if node is None: return
            helper(node.left)
            seq.append(node.val)
            helper(node.right)
            return
        
        helper(root)
        res = seq[-1]
        for i in range(len(seq)-1):
            res = min(res, seq[i+1] - seq[i])
        return res
```
