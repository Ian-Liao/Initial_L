Minimum Size Subarray Sum
---

# Description
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

Example: 

Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n). 

# Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, s: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = len(nums) + 1
        low, cur = 0, 0
        for high, val in enumerate(nums):
            cur += val
            while cur >= s:
                res = min(res, high - low + 1)
                cur -= nums[low]
                low += 1
            
        return res if res <= len(nums) else 0
```
