56 Merge Intervals
---

# Description
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:

Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considerred overlapping.

# Solution
```python
# Definition for an interval.
# class Interval:
#     def __init__(self, s=0, e=0):
#         self.start = s
#         self.end = e

class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals):
        """
        :type intervals: List[Interval]
        :rtype: List[Interval]
        """
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x.start)
        i = 1
        while i < len(intervals):
            if intervals[i].start <= intervals[i-1].end:
                intervals[i-1].end = max(intervals[i-1].end, intervals[i].end)
                intervals.pop(i)
            else:
                i += 1
                
        return intervals
```
