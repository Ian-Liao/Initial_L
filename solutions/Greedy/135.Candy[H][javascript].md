Candy
---

# Description
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

Example 1:

Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

# Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} ratings
 * @return {number}
 */
var candy = function(ratings) {
    var len = ratings.length;
    var arr = _.range(len).map(function () { return 1 });
    for(var i = 1; i < len; i++) {
        if(ratings[i] > ratings[i-1])
            arr[i] = arr[i-1]+1;
    }
    for(var i = len-1; i > 0; i--) {
        if(ratings[i] < ratings[i-1] && arr[i] >= arr[i-1])
            arr[i-1] = arr[i]+1;
    }
    return arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
};
```
