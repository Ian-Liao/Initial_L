Validate Stack Sequences

# Description
946. Validate Stack Sequences
Medium

Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.

 

Example 1:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1

Example 2:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.

 

Note:

    0 <= pushed.length == popped.length <= 1000
    0 <= pushed[i], popped[i] < 1000
    pushed is a permutation of popped.
    pushed and popped have distinct values.


# Solution
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} pushed
 * @param {number[]} popped
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var validateStackSequences = function(pushed, popped) {
    var i = 0, j = 0, stack = [];
    while(j < popped.length) {
        if(stack[stack.length-1] === popped[j]) {
            stack.pop();
            j++;
        } else {
            if(i === pushed.length)
                return false;
            while(popped[j] !== pushed[i]) {
                stack.push(pushed[i]);
                i++;
                if(i === pushed.length) 
                    return false;
            }
            i++;
            j++;
        }
    }
    return true;
};
```
